# Radio-Creator
This Java project is a multi-class program that creates two radio objects each with its own AM/FM band, volume, and frequency.  The program adjusts these data members and prints out each radio's attributes.


Radios can be tuned to stations on either the AM Band or the FM band. Each band
has its own range of frequencies that can be used by a radio station broadcaster.
The AM band in the United States covers frequencies from 540 kHz up to 1700 kHz, in 10 kHz steps (540,
550, 560 ... 1680, 1690, 1700).
The FM broadcast in the United States starts at 88.0 MHz and ends at 108.0 MHz. The band is divided
into 100 channels, each 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide. The center frequency is located at 1/2 the bandwidth
of the FM Channel, or 100 kHz (0.1 MHz) up from the lower end of the channel. (So the next channel up
from 88.0 is 88.1, the next after that is 88.3...and so on.)
A radio will also have an On/OFF Switch and a Volume dial for sound
